  A really trivial example of how to create a class hierarchy in JavaScript.

  This is NOT the only way to emulate classical OOP in JavaScript.  It may not
  even be the best way.  But it's a solution and hopefully it'll prove useful
  for beginners.

  Enjoy!

  // Everything in JavaScript is global by default!
  // Here's a really simple way to emulate namespaces in JavaScript.
  var MyNamespace = MyNamespace || {};

  // Define a sample "class" inside our namespace.
  // As of this writing, JavaScript does not support classes
  // (although it will in ECMAScript 6).
  // You emulate classes by creating a function with members, like so:
  MyNamespace.Human = function(firstName, lastName, creditCard)
  {
    // Your "class" is really just one big function.  When you instantiate an
    // object of this class using the *new* keyword, your class definition
    // does double-duty as a constructor and is called like a regular function.
    console.log ("Constructor called!");

    // Defining a property on *this* creates a local property that can vary for
    // each instance.
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;

    // A private varable.  Because it's not set as a property using *this*, it's
    // not accessible outside of this function.
    var _creditCard = creditCard;

    // A public method.  Note it can access the private variables in this class.
    this.getCreditCard = function()
    {
      return _creditCard;
    };

  };

  // Here's another way of defining a public method.  You can pull it outside
  // the scope of the constructor function.  Note that if you do this, you
  // CANNOT access private variables due to scoping.
  MyNamespace.Human.prototype.getFullName = function()
  {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  };

  // *prototype* is an important concept in JavaScript.
  // If you want to learn more about it works, I have an in-depth example here:
  // https://github.com/stevekwan/experiments/blob/master/javascript/constructor-vs-prototype.html

  // For a public static property, define it as a property of the constructor
  // function itself.  This way it is NOT unique to every given instance.
  MyNamespace.Human.scientificName = "Homo sapiens";

  // Here's how you access the public static property.
  MyNamespace.Human.prototype.getScientificName = function()
  {
    return MyNamespace.Human.scientificName;
  };





  console.log("Now that we've defined a class, let's instantiate an object!");
  var steveKwan = new MyNamespace.Human("Steve", "Kwan", 6543210987654321);

  // This is a public variable, so we can access it.
  console.log(steveKwan.firstName);

  // This is a private variable, so we can't.
  console.log(steveKwan._creditCard);

  // But there's a public method we can use to access that private variable!
  console.log(steveKwan.getCreditCard());

  // Here's another public method I can use as a helper.
  console.log(steveKwan.getFullName());






  console.log(''); // Just here for console formatting




  console.log("Let's create another instance.");
  var johnDoe = new MyNamespace.Human("John", "Doe", 1234567890123456);

  console.log(''); // Just here for console formatting

  console.log("Static variables are the same for all instances...");
  console.log(steveKwan.getScientificName());
  console.log(johnDoe.getScientificName());

  console.log(''); // Just here for console formatting

  console.log("Changing a static variable affects all instances...");
  MyNamespace.Human.scientificName = "Homo sapiens sapiens";
  console.log(steveKwan.getScientificName());
  console.log(johnDoe.getScientificName());





  // That's it for now!

  // At some point I'd like to extend this and give some examples of how
  // inheritance works in JavaScript.

  // Hope this helps!
