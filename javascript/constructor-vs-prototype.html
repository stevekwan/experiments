  tl;dr: "Classes" in JavaScript consist of a constructor function and prototype
  object that point to each other.

  // I'll be using the traditional OOP terminology of class/object here,
  // despite the fact that JavaScript doesn't use the concept of classes.
  // Hoping that by using this terminology it'll clarify the object model
  // for people coming from a traditional OOP background...

  // It's worth noting that the concept of classes may be coming sooner than we
  // think, though:
  // http://addyosmani.com/blog/a-few-new-things-coming-to-javascript/

  // But in the meantime, we do OOP via the constructor/prototype relationship.
  // So here we go...

  // Define a "class" called Employee.  Again, note that JavaScript doesn't have
  // any such thing as a class...yet.  So this is actually just an object, like
  // any other.
  var Employee = function()
  {
    // Let's add a default property to Employee.  Note that this is the WRONG
    // way to do it!  We'll illustrate why in a bit...
    this.company = "EA";

    // Maybe a bit presumptuous of me to assume everyone works at my company by
    // default...
  };

  // Let's add some more default properties to Employee.  This is the RIGHT way
  // to do it.  It's also our first exposure to prototype, a very important
  // concept in JavaScript OOP.
  Employee.prototype.division = "Sports";
  Employee.prototype.country  = "Canada";

  // Great!  Now let's create a helper function that prints out an employee.
  Employee.prototype.print = function()
  {
    var output =
      this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName + ', ' + // First the name
      this.division + ' division, ' +               // Then division
      this.company + ' ' + this.country + '.';       // Then company/location
    console.log(output);
  };

  // Now let's create a new object based off of our "class"...
  var steve = new Employee();

  // Looking good so far.  Now let's fill in my name:
  steve.firstName = "Steve";
  steve.lastName  = "Kwan";

  console.log("My employee object...");
  steve.print();
  console.log(''); // This is just for console display formatting
  // Output:
  // My employee object...
  // Steve Kwan, Sports division, EA Canada.

  // So far so good!  Now let's create another employee: my boss!
  var andrew       = new Employee();
  andrew.firstName = "Andrew";
  andrew.lastName  = "Wilson";

  // Only thing is, Andrew works in California.
  andrew.country = "USA";

  // Let's see what we've got!
  console.log("Steve and Andrew...");
  steve.print();
  andrew.print();
  console.log('');
  // Output:
  // Steve and Andrew...
  // Steve Kwan, Sports division, EA Canada.
  // Andrew Wilson, Sports division, EA USA.

  // Looking good so far!

  // ...Oops.  I realize I made a typo.  Our division isn't called "Sports"...
  // it's actually "EA SPORTS".  Common mistake:
  // http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcw_G0oK6Ns

  // While we're at it, let's also rename the company from EA to the proper
  // name, "Electronic Arts".

  // So let's change the default in our class definition and try again:
  Employee.company            = "Electronic Arts";
  Employee.prototype.division = "EA SPORTS"; // It's in the game!

  // And let's make sure our change took effect...
  console.log("After changing company and division...");
  steve.print();
  andrew.print();
  console.log('');
  // Output:
  // After changing company and division...
  // Steve Kwan, EA SPORTS division, EA Canada.
  // Andrew Wilson, EA SPORTS division, EA USA.

  // Uh oh.  The rename didn't work...at least, not completely.  The division
  // was properly renamed to "EA SPORTS", but the company name is still wrong.
  // Why?

  // Let's go back and take a look at how we declared those two defaults:
  // this.company = "EA";
  // Employee.prototype.division = "Sports";

  // The big difference is that division uses the prototype keyword.  And that's
  // the one that worked.

  // Welcome to object-oriented JavaScript.  :)

  // In more "sane" object-oriented languages, you create a class, you spawn
  // objects off of them, and you're done with it.  If you need to make a global
  // change you do it at the class level, and all instantiated objects pick up
  // that change automatically.  But JavaScript is NOT a "sane" object-oriented
  // language.

  // Instead, JavaScript uses what's called prototypal OOP.  For the best
  // possible explanation of how this stacks up to classical OOP, I recommend
  // reading The Good Parts, by Douglas Crockford:
  // http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do

  // In JavaScript, when you define a "class," you are actually just defining a
  // constructor function.  This is the function that gets called whenever you
  // use the var employee = new Employee() syntax.  Use of the new keyword tells
  // JavaScript to create a new object and invoke Employee as its constructor.

  // The important thing to note is that Employee is NOT actually a class!  It's
  // a regular object like any other.  It just happens to do double duty as a
  // constructor.  But you can assign and manipulate properties on it just like
  // any other object.  For example:
  Employee.favoriteFood = "Chicken";

  // And this change will NOT be propagated to all instances of Employee,
  // because they were already created long ago.
  console.log("What's my favorite food?");
  console.log(steve.favoriteFood);
  console.log('');
  // Output:
  // What's my favorite food?
  // undefined

  // See?  No chicken!

  // If you want to actually add something to a class definition so it affects
  // all instances, you put it in prototype:
  delete Employee.favoriteFood; // Get rid of the old one...
  Employee.prototype.favoriteFood = "Chicken";

  // Now let's try again...
  console.log("Delicious, delicious meat...");
  console.log(steve.favoriteFood);
  console.log('');
  // Output:
  // Delicious, delicious meat...
  // Chicken

  // So that begs the question...WTF is a prototype?

  // Whenever you define a function, it gets an automatically created property
  // called prototype.  The prototype property points to a special "prototype"
  // object, which is also automatically created with each function.  It is THAT
  // object that contains all the shared "members" for your "class."  Confused
  // yet?  :)

  // The important takeaway is: in other languages a class is a single thing,
  // but "class" definitions in JavaScript are split into TWO PARTS:
  // 1: The constructor (a plain old function), such as Employee
  // 2: The prototype, an automatically created object that every function gets.
  // So a "class" is actually TWO separate objects!

  // The constructor (or for that matter, any function) has an automatically-
  // created property called prototype, which points to an automatically-
  // created prototype object.

  // The prototype is an object automatically created for every function, and it
  // has an automatically-created attribute called constructor, which points
  // back to the constructor function.

  // Through these two properties, the two objects "link" to each other and are
  // able to provide constructor/property functionality.

  // To truly understand constructor and prototype - and the far more confusing
  // __proto__ property - I recommend reading this great article by Joost
  // Diepenmaat:
  // http://joost.zeekat.nl/constructors-considered-mildly-confusing.html

  // Anyway, now that we (hopefully) understand the relationship between
  // constructor and prototype, let's fix our example from before.

  delete Employee.company;                        // Remove from constructor
  Employee.prototype.company = "Electronic Arts"; // Put it in the right place

  // So let's check our changes...
  console.log("Checking our fix...");
  steve.print();
  andrew.print();
  console.log('');
  // Output:
  // Checking our fix...
  // Steve Kwan, EA SPORTS division, EA Canada.
  // Andrew Wilson, EA SPORTS division, EA USA.

  // Huh?  Why does the company name still say EA?  We deleted Employee.company.
  // What's going on?

  // The answer is actually pretty simple.  The line:
  // this.company = "EA";
  // Is in the constructor for Employee.  Whenever new Employee() is invoked,
  // that line is executed for the new Employe object being created.  And
  // because it uses the this keyword, it is binding the company property
  // TO THE NEW EMPLOYEE, not to the shared object.

  // So yes, we removed company from Employee...but we did it AFTER the
  // constructor had already been called.  Both the steve and andrew objects
  // wound up with their own company properties, which we now need to delete.

  // Let's clean that up.
  delete steve.company;
  delete andrew.company;

  // Now let's try again:
  console.log("FINALLY...");
  steve.print();
  andrew.print();
  console.log('');
  // Steve Kwan, EA SPORTS division, Electronic Arts Canada.
  // Andrew Wilson, EA SPORTS division, Electronic Arts USA.

  // Yay!

  // I hope this does a good job of explaining how JavaScript handles OOP via
  // the use of constructor and prototype.  This can be a real mind-bender for
  // someone coming from a classical OOP background in languages like Java.

  // I know I've already repeated this many times, but if you really want to
  // understand constructor and prototype, I highly recommend Joost's article:
  // http://joost.zeekat.nl/constructors-considered-mildly-confusing.html
